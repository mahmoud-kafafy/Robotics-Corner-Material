# Size vs Capacity


### ðŸ”¹ Initial

```cpp
vector<int> v;
```

* size = 0
* capacity = 0

(no memory allocated yet)

---

### ðŸ”¹ After `v.push_back(10);`

* size = 1
* capacity = 1

ðŸ‘‰ First allocation happens: vector reserves space for 1 element.

---

### ðŸ”¹ After `v.push_back(20);`

* size = 2
* old capacity was 1 â†’ not enough
* capacity doubles to 2

---

### ðŸ”¹ After `v.push_back(30);`

* size = 3
* old capacity was 2 â†’ not enough
* capacity doubles to 4

---

### ðŸ”¹ After `v.push_back(40);`

* size = 4
* still fits in capacity 4
* capacity = 4

---

### ðŸ”¹ After `v.push_back(50);`

* size = 5
* old capacity was 4 â†’ not enough
* capacity doubles to 8

---

âœ… So the pattern is:

* Start: size 0, capacity 0
* 1st element â†’ capacity = 1
* When size > capacity â†’ allocate new capacity â‰ˆ 2 Ã— old capacity

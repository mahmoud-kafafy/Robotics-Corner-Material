// ðŸ§  Step-by-step explanation:

// weak_ptr<int> weakNum;
// â†’ starts empty, doesnâ€™t point to anything.

// auto sharedNum = make_shared<int>(10);
// â†’ creates a shared pointer owning the integer 10.

// weakNum = sharedNum;
// â†’ weak pointer now observes the shared pointer but does not increase the count.

// Inside the block:

// The object still exists, so weakNum.lock() succeeds and gives us a temporary shared_ptr to access the value.

// After the block:

// sharedNum is destroyed, so the object is deleted.

// Now weakNum.lock() fails (returns nullptr) â†’ the object expired.
